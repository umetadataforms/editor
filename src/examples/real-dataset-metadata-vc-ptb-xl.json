  "title": "Large Publicly Available Electrocardiography Dataset (PTB-XL)",
  "description": "PTB-XL is a large publicly available electrocardiography (ECG) dataset containing clinical 12-lead ECG signals from 21,837 records of 18,885 patients. It is designed for machine learning and deep learning research, and includes both raw signals and extensive annotations in a structured form.",
  "purpose": "To provide a large-scale benchmark dataset for ECG analysis and machine learning-based classification, diagnosis, prognosis prediction, as well as generative tasks such as synthesis and data augmentation.",
  "disease": "Cardiac conditions",
  "study_design": "Retrospective observational study conducted using ECG data from routine clinical care at a tertiary care hospital.",
  "patient_num": 18885,
  "patient_criteria": "Inclusion: ECG recordings from patients referred to a tertiary care university hospital for suspected cardiovascular conditions. Exclusion: ECG recordings with corrupted or missing leads were excluded.",
  "target_variables": "Diagnostic labels including myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, ST/T changes, hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and other ECG abnormalities.",

The data were collected using Schiller AG ECG devices during routine care. Each recording is 10 seconds long and has been annotated by cardiologists. Two versions are available: raw signals at 500 Hz and downsampled versions at 100 Hz.",
