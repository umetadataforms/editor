The form is designed to capture the information necessary to understand the clinical context, cohort selection, and the collection or mining, quantification, and processing of the underlying data.\n\nComplete all applicable fields based on available documentation and knowledge of the dataset. Use rich text formatting where needed; the raw text will be stored in HTML format.\n\nEach form field is accompanied by a structured description:\n- required fields are marked with a red start before their label.\n- summary sentence — a single, clear sentence that defines what the field is,\n- use — explanation of how the provided information could be used,\n- guidelines — specific instructions on how to fill in the field correctly, where needed,\n- constraints — character or list size limits, where relevant,\n- missing information — clarification of missing and not applicable cases, where needed,\n- examples — |-separated field content examples, provided only if the examples are short.\n",
