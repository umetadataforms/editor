## Licence

This software is licensed under the terms of the  MIT licence. Please read
it carefully before using this software: [LICENCE](./LICENSE).

<br>

## Installation

In the commands below, replace `<version>` with the version number from the latest test release.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Download `umetadataformseditor_<version>_amd64.deb` from the latest test [release].

To install, run:
``` bash
sudo apt install ./umetadataformseditor_<version>_amd64.deb
```
If the app doesn't launch, or has issues, try launching it from the command line
to see the error messages.

To uninstall, run:
``` bash
sudo apt remove umetadataformseditor
```
or
``` bash
sudo apt purge umetadataformseditor
```
After uninstalling, delete `~/.config/uMetadataFormsEditor` folder to
remove all application settings.

### Linux App Image

Download `uMetadataFormsEditor-<version>.AppImage` from latest test [release].

You need FUSE to run app images:
```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```
Make the app image file executable:
```bash
chmod u+x uMetadataFormsEditor-<version>.AppImage
```
Run:
```bash
./uMetadataFormsEditor-<version>.AppImage
```
Depending on your system configuration, you may need to run the application
without a sandbox. Please be aware that running third-party software without
sandboxing can pose security risks.
```bash
./uMetadataFormsEditor-<version>.AppImage --no-sandbox
```
If the app doesn't launch, or has issues, try launching it from the command line
to see the error messages.

To uninstall, delete the app image file and delete
`~/.config/uMetadataFormsEditor` folder to remove all application settings.

<br>

### Windows 11

Download `uMetadataFormsEditor-Setup-<version>.exe` from the latest test [release]. 

To install, double click the `exe` file.

To uninstall, use the Windows uninstaller.

After uninstalling the app, delete the following folders:  
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\uMetadataFormsEditor`, and  
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\umetadataformseditor-updater`,  
where `<username>` is your Windows user name.

<br>

### MacOS

**WARNING**: The Mac version hasn't been tested properly and seems to run very
slowly, and as such, practically not usable at the moment.

**Important**: The application is not signed or notarised. MacOS will show
a security warning when you try to open it because it comes from an
unidentified developer.

If you still want to test the Mac version, download the appropriate MacOS
installer from the latest test [release].

When uninstalling, you might need to delete the application support folder, probably:  
`~/Library/Application Support/uMetadataFormsEditor`.

## Known Issues

- **MacOS support**

  The MacOS version is currently experimental, has poor performance, and may be
  unstable. It is not recommended for real use at this time.

- **Form validation messages**

  Validation errors appear both as a full list at the top of the form and at the
  bottom of relevant fields when you press the **Validate** button. The preview
  panel also shows field validation errors when displaying their preview;
  however, the preview panel does not display custom validation errors, such as
  checking whether the start date is before the end date in temporal coverage.

- **Typing / debouncing behaviour**

  Typing in text fields is debounced: changes are committed 1.8 seconds after
  the last keystroke. When typing slowly or pausing between words, this can make
  the interface feel a bit jerky.

- **UI performance**

  The Ant Design component library is relatively heavy and contributes to the
  application feeling slower than it should be.

- **Export**

  The file exporter defaults to the downloads folder rather than the current
  working directory.
